			<br/><br><h3>Manchester, England 1980s</h3> <br/>
			 
			<p>I have always had an enquiring mind and I've always been ambitious too. Having being born into a working class family and raised on a housing estate north of the Great City of Manchester I had a burning desire for physical, financial and mental improvement and a drive to get out into the great big world and grab what was mine. Unlike most of the factory fodder at my school I  later graduated from a red brick university with a broad based degree in the Sciences and, at the time, thought the world would be at my feet. However my education was only just starting. 
			</p>
			<p>After sitting around for a while waiting for the world to come to me then after much effort I obtained a position as a trainee accountant in the city of Manchester, the first step up the slippery pole of the world of commerce. This was in the days before the personal computer revolution so the job of a trainee accountant or auditor was to check the accuracy of paper based bookkeeping systems used by a company and verify the accuracy of any accounts produced from them.  
			</p>
			<p>This was achieved by a process known as  "ticking". You had to sit at a desk all day checking that the figures entered in a company's Sales Day Book tallied to the figures entered  in the company's Sales Ledger by placing a corresponding tick against the figures in both books – repetitive tedious work. No enquiries into the fundamental building blocks of the universe, no deep philosophical enquiries into life, death and the purpose of existence, no glamorous flirtations with armies of beautiful intelligent girls no – just ticking. Hours and hours of tedious ticking, was this what I had studied so hard for? Was this the way to discover the wonders of the world? Would this bring me excitement, fame and fortune beyond belief? No! No! A thousand times No! I hated it. 
			</p>
			<p>Yet there was those who thought I was lucky and maybe slightly envied my position! One of the elder employees in the firm to which I had  indentured myself for the foreseeable future thought I was very lucky indeed. He regaled me with tales of "the good old days" - which sounded like something out of Dickens. Yes the good old days when the office was filled with serried rows of great coated figures stood up at their desks entering copperplate figures by quill into leather bound ledgers and adding up long pages of Pounds, Shilling and Pence in the head. The prospect of a career in accountancy (whether now or in the pas)  filled me with dread. 
			</p>
			<p>I felt as though my life had taken a turn down a blind alley and I didn't know how to back up or where my destination was. 
			</p> 
			<p>Like most of us I have been brainwashed by my teachers educators and others to accept the perceived wisdom that I had grown up with. Soon I began to realize that most people live their lives inside an invisible prison of their own making. Bound to live by someone else clock, run by someone else's rules and all to make money for someone else. Like a rat in a glass maze running frantic with the vision of wealth and freedom dangled like a carrot forever out of reach it was always "jam tomorrow". They were paying for the illusion of security with their very lives. I too was disillusioned and stuck in a massive rut travelling every morning by bus into the city for another day of mind numbing tedium for which I was supposed to feel grateful and count myself as among the lucky ones for having got so far up the slippery pole when their were millions without even a job. 
			</p>
			<p>None of these depressing musings was able to kill my curiosity though, I was still inquisitive and had an insatiable desire to learn, the system hadn't crushed that out of me. I even now posses a rabid curiosity about life and my place in the great mechanism of the world and how I could progress in it and improve my position. And get out of this ever growing rut that I was digging for myself. 
			</p>
			<p>But what was there to do in the evenings but travel home by bus for a few hours worth of mind numbing TV before sleeping and then getting back on the bus to repeat this torture all over again? So I began to spend my evenings in the central reading room of Manchester's Central Library – a huge book filled circus of a room with terrible acoustics. Before the library closed at eight and I  trawled off home I studied avidly looking for some higher purpose to life than decades of ticking. I digested volumes reading Marx, Aristotle, Nietzsche, Plato, Einstein... all the great philosophers and thinkers of the ages. 
			</p> 
			<p>My studies took a different path from the rigid course based paths at university and instead I was now reading in a more dynamic style One book would spark off a question which pointed me into another direction now only to fly off at a tangent to another writer and another direction. I read eastern philosophy, spiritual works, political tracts, scientific texts still seeking some purpose meaning or escape from the track which society had offered me. 
			</p> 
			<p>Then one evening on the bus on the way home I had an epiphany, I saw that I was trapped in an invisible prison which I had helped create, a prison of conformity and belief which would forever see me enslaved. Despite my "intelligence" I would also be accountable to some master upon whom I always would rely for my livelihood. And what if at some point I married and had children, people who were dependent on me? Then I'd be further bound by other people's necessity to the nine to five drudgery and financial enslavement of whoever had the upper hand. But wasn't this the way Marx saw it when he stated in his Das Kapital that... 
			"In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations." 
			</p> 
			<p>The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. 
			Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat. 
			Of course where Marx had got it wrong was in predicting the overthrow of this order to be replaced with a new equitable society where all are equal. What has actually happened is that the "Bourgeoisie" as he put have gone into hiding and still exert the financial upper hand over the "Proletariat" by internalizing the voice of control as a set of modern values. The proles subjugate themselves by buying into the myths and pie in the sky rewards of their capitalist taskmasters.  
			</p> 
			<p>Throughout my studies one fact seemed to repeat itself no matter whom the writer and no matter In what age they wrote, this was that the fact was that society was graduated into  two broad classes the "haves" and the "have nots". The only difference was that nowadays this distinction was  not forced upon us by power, coercion, belief, church or state as in the past but by some subtle psychological trick which had become implanted within us. Most of us now seem to carry around our own internal policeman inside our heads who rationalizes the inequities in the system by internally nagging us about our obligations, duties and what society expects of us. That is to toe the line and charge away through the rat race until we were no longer productive and drop out of the race to enjoy a well earned but short retirement. 
			</p> 
			<p>I rejected all this as unfair, wrong and unacceptable. There must be a way of breaking out of this glass shell and becoming one of the small number whom I had witnessed who were exempt from this conditioning, One of those who had ample time, cash and more importantly freedom to follow their own interest and instinct and not those of the paymasters and overlords. This became my obsession as I read and studied in the large Central Library of Manchester at night looking for a way out of my prison I dreamt of riches freedom, strength  knowledge and power. This would not be mine whilst my best hours were spend tethered to a desk on a trainee accounts pay. 
			</p> 
			<p>But I didn't want to do what Marx had suggested when he surveyed the vast inequities of the system in the form it was when he wrote, life is too short for revolution. No I had no interest in changing the world and attempting to create freedom for the oppressed masses (or Ragged Trousered Philanthropists as another write had termed them) no I wanted to choose which of those two classes I belonged to. I wanted be one of that secret elite who have the freedom and wealth to live as they wished, to go where they wanted and to enjoy the full fruits of man's endeavors during a long self determined life, I wanted evolution. I wanted to transform my present condition from wage slave to freedom, but how? 
			</p> 
			<p>It was during my nocturnal studies that I stumbled across the works of Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist of all time. I had studied his works during my University years and marveled at his great genius. His great mind had encompassed many things including the arcane world of Alchemy about which there were many misconceptions. In fact the more I read about Newton's alchemical writings the more I was fascinated. Partly because his scientific writings and laws of motion had formed the basis of all mechanical science accurate enough to put  a man on the moon. But, strangely I thought at the time his scientific work was only a small part of the vast range of questions around which his great mind roamed. In fact the majority of the study and labors of that great scientist life were spent on the study of  Alchemy, his Physics seemed to have been a mere side study his true center of enquiry revolved around more esoteric matters.  
			As I read more I discovered that the notion of alchemy is a vastly misunderstood, most of use when asked might say that Alchemy was about "converting base metals into gold" - well this is partly true, it's an allegory for improving, evolving or transmuting physical or psychic matter into a high form. In fact the best definition might be to transform man in our base enslaved state to a perfect free and unrestrained being. But this is only part of the explanation.

			<p>The Central Library in Manchester didn't have many books on Newton's Alchemical studies it almost seems as though they had somehow been suppressed or hidden away,. I was only able to track down a rare translation of some of his alchemical writings in a small gothic closed library on Deansgate. I joined that library and then after work one evening paid my first visit to the gothic splendor that was it's central reading room. The book I had requested was held in a closed access system and I had to fill in a card before the book would be brought out to me, I waited about ten minutes before a middle aged lady in spectacles and flat shoes brought the book out to me. It was leather bound and had a musty smell about it but clearly on the gold tooled leather spine could I read the title, Newton's name and the name of the translator. With trembling hands I took the book over to a reading table and slowly turned the first pages, the book had facsimiles of Newton's writing on the left hand side of the page with annotations and translations on the right hand side of the page, I was glad of this because the text seemed impenetrable but I gazed at in awe. Newton's writing was small, a sign of high intelligence, writing In quill were illustrations, numbers, symbols, calculations – strange sketching diagrams and tables, ultimately inscrutable at first but the figures held fascination. 
			 </p>
			<p>For several days afterwards After work I came to study this book, eventually the lady librarian got to know me by sight and had the book ready for me each evening. And it was on one dark November evening when most of the workers in the city where scuttling back home through the rain drenched streets that I, sat alone in that library had my "eureka" moment. I had almost deciphered what Newton's symbols actually meant and with the help of the translation was reading through a procedure, some might call it a spell or process for bringing about a desired outcome. For in other words turning  a base situation into a golden one. I recognized what Newton had actually written out was an algorithm – a set of steps to produce an intended outcome rather like a mathematical proof or chemical process. 
			</p>

			<p>One example might be to transmute base metal into gold although this is just one specific example of a more general process of transmuting an object system, thing or condition into a more evolved higher and finer version of itself. I saw the great power and generality in what I dubbed The Alchemical Algorithm – but could it be applied tp anything, anyone or more specifically me? Would it work? There was only one way to find out; by experiment! I made notes and a list of the items I would need to perform the Alchemical Algorithm. I resolved to gather all the required materials over the weekend and perform my first experiment on the Sunday. I also needed to think of an outcome to conjure into being or a life situation to transmute or improve. For my first attempt at this experiment I decided that all I could reasonably ask for is proof that the Algorithm worked.  
			</p> 
			<p>On the way back to the bus that evening I fancied I could see some of Newton's alchemical symbols in the architecture above me. Hidden in plain view masters of old had hidden references to these secrets know only to a few. I was filled with excitement and anticipation. The yellow streetlights glowed in the Novemner drizzle as I, with fleet foot, mmade my way home. 
			</p>
			<p>And so on the Sunday having gathered all the materials required and having gained silence and seclusion I wrote out the final step in the process that I was about to test. I wrote one word – simply "proof". After I had run the algorithm I felt a sense of calm, I slept well that night despite the fact that I knew I was about to return to the rat race the following morning.  
			</p>
			<p>The next morning whilst walking form the bus to the office I caught site of someone across the road, someone vaguely familiar. I was surprised to recognize that it was only my own reflection in a shop window. But somehow I looked slightly changed, more purposeful, more dynamic walking erect and proud unlike the other people in the city on their way to work who seemed to be huddled and staring at their feet. In fact a few even got out of my way and avoided me as I strided into the office with my head held high and a new feeling of optimism, My work colleagues seemed to notice this also I sensed that they were treating me with a little more respect rather than part of the furniture. People were treating me with more respect, using my first name and asking my opinions for a change. 
			This continued throughout the day, was this the result of running the algorithm over the weekend? I had asked for proof and this seemed to be it. By the end of the day I resolved to try again but with a more definite intended outcome. This time I would ask for money. 
			That evening I went through the spell, process or algorithm (call it what you will)  again with the outcome stated as financial gain. Come to think about it this seemed a much better idea then just asking for proof.  
			Then the trail went cold, nothing happened for two days until the Thursday. I strode confidently into work as I had on the last few days and on my way to my desk I notices a letter in my pigeon hole. I took it to my desk, sat down then opened it. I started to read. By the time I had read the letter my hands were trembling. The letter was from the payroll department at the firm I worked form (no email in those days) stating that they had made an error by applying the wrong tax code when I started employment with them and that consequently my next payment would include a refund of several hundred pounds. Quite a sum in those days! Coincidence? Or the running of the Alchemical algorithm (as I had now christened it). I decided it was time for further experimentation. I did not attend the library that week  I felt that I had in some way found what I was seeking – a method to improve my current life situation in each dynamic. I chose the next area of my life to optimize and being a young man in my early twenties I'm sure you can guess where I wanted success to arrive next!

			<p>This being the era before internet dating and meeting women was hard work but I set the process in place and confidently awaitied luck, cupid or whatever force I was experimenting with to operate. The next day I was walking down one of the streets of the city at lunchtime when it happened. Across the road I saw two women, probably office girls, walking together, talking laughing and joking over some minor piece of trivia, both smiling, carefree and very pretty. Despite the season they were both wearing short skirts and clopping down the pavement in high heels when, for no apparent reason, they both darted out into the road, weaved tightly through the traffic over to my side of the road where they were now walking straight towards me. Then, as if I was invisible, they both collided straight into me, with much embarrassed giggling and apologies. What an icebreaker! We got chatting and I got their names and their phone numbers one even had her pen ready in her handbag. I chose Jane who had taken my eye and, with new found confidence rang her for the office that afternoon and made  a date for the weekend. Which proved to be very fruitfull if you get my drift. Since then I have never been without female companionship – all thanks to the algorithm - or is it just luck, coincidence and serendipity? 
			I was now very excited, I had stumbled on a way to improve or create massive improvement in the conditions in any area of my life by running a simple process or algorithm. Feeling I had discovered a great secret I also felt a sense of responsibility in using that power. I didn't want to use the algorithm to produce a bad or evil outcome although I was at times tempted. A simple three ton weight falling out of the sky onto the heads of one of my employers produced a comforting and amusing image I also had to think about the consequences involved in using the algorithm.  
			</p>
			<p>With power comes responsibility and I think I intuitively realized that I should only attempt to bring about positive outcomes using the algorithm. In fact I took some time out, believe it or not I arrived at work the next day and was turned away because due to an accident by one of the internal contractors, our floor had no power, If I would come back tomorrow it should all be fixed and don't worry we will still pay you for the day. With nothing else to do I caught a bus to one of the larger parks and open spaces north of the town and spent half the way wandering round the lawns, bushes and country house in silent contemplation in the cold bright winter's afternoon, Here I thought about the power I had stumbled on, how I should use it in a responsible manner and what changes in my life I wished to bring about.

			<p>To do this I pictured my life and existence as I wished it would be and listed the things area I wanted to improve and what their final condition should be. Also for some reason I knew I had to use this power responsibly and sparingly, if fact after setting the transmutation process in motion back then I have rarely had to use the algorithm in the last few years except to tweak and improve certain areas or to respond to new problems, issues  and conditions that did not exist when I first set this great process in motion. I mentally came up with a number of classifications or dynamics in which I wanted to improve my existence they were Money, health, freedom, romance, creativity etc. 
			Using the Alchemical Algorithm immediately transformed my life within a couple of weeks in the following ways.... 
			I bought my first car, with cash and even had enough to pay for the exorbitant cost of a new drivers insurance? 
			I took my first foreign holiday to Spain with a charming young lady who one day "walked" into my life. 
			I passed my professional accountancy exams at the top of the class and was subsequently prompted several times and began to get calls from headhunters 
			</p> 
			<p>I now live in a large detached house in one of the more affluent areas south of the city, it must be worth nearly a million pounds though I've no intention of selling it. 
			I am now financially independent with passive income being generated from a diverse portfolio of investments. I run my own lifestyle business which generates more than enough income for my family 
			I have many friends from all walks of life and am respected in my own community. 
			I own a Mercedes SLK – silver grey not a new model or too ostentatious, the more you know the less you show has always been my motto. 
			I have a beautiful intelligent partner who literally "walked into my life" one day – we are a perfect match and it seems incredible that we should have met by chance one day. 
			We have three wonderful children whose financial future and education is secure 
			We enjoy foreign travel and have been all over the world 
			But most important of all I have freedom to follow my own desires and business interests and not dance to the clock and whim of any taskmaster for the "security" that might bring. 
			I have used the algorithm sparingly throughout my life and shared with others the fruits and rewards it has delivered to me. I donate to charitable causes but I do not wish to elaborate upon this as true charity shouldn't reflect upon oneself.  
			So why do I wish to share this secret with you now? Well let me tell you I have tried to share the secret with other, friends, family members etc but have been met with solid skepticism all the way. I have a cousin who was in dire financial straits who laughed in my face when I tried to disclose the secret to him, In fact I've come to the conclusion that the alchemical algorithm  is a secret hiding in plain view purely because nobody will suspend their skepticism and make a few simple steps to prove the worth of this ancient wisdom for themselves. 
			</p> 
			<p>After reading this far you may have carried with you a small burden of skepticism Well you perhaps you're 
			expecting me to sell you something. Well you could not be more wrong - this secret is not mine to sell so I'm going to disclose it to
			you without charge. Besides I have enough money of my own why should I want any of yours?
